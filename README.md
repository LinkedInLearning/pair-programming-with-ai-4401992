If you’re a programmer, you’re probably curious (and maybe a little apprehensive) about what artificial intelligence can do for your work. In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows you how you can supercharge your software development with the help of an AI pair programmer. Morten shares practical strategies and hands-on practice on how to leverage AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to increase productivity and write better code. He demonstrates how to employ AI to address common tasks, how different AI tools differ, and offers an understanding of what is possible, how AI tools can fit into your work, and—importantly—where the current limits and guardrails are.

## Instructions

The exercise files for this course are provided as a playground for you to experiment with using various AI tools as pair programmers. As such there is no progressive project or even specific code examples provided here. Instead there is a static web page project (the `/static` folder), a partially built React.js project (the `/react` folder), and an empty `/playground` folder where you can place your own files.

## Installing

To run the build process for the react project:

1. Open a Terminal.
2. In Terminal, Navigate to the `/react` folder.
3. Type in `npm install` and press Enter.
4. Type in `npm run dev` and press Enter.
   This starts the Vite build process and dev server.
